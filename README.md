# data-projects
this includes both the ipynb file and a pdf so you are able to view our outputs for the maps/plots which cannot be seen in the ipynb file
In order to run the our code first run all import statements including the data set we are using 
To view interact plots and maps please view the pdf version. For the bird_project the data set that was used was bird_tracking.csv while for the group 5 project penguins.csv was used. Both are provided alongside the project
